### General Info

This was a challenge for me as it was my first object oriented js project. 
I am currently completing a personal "15 JavaScript projects" challenge this month to further my capabilities with JS.
I am focusing on manipulating the DOM to looping through arrays, using new methods, and imporving my problem solving capabilities withing JS.
I chose this project in particular because I have a toddler that would benifit from this memory game, and he loves it! Hashtag proud daddy here.
